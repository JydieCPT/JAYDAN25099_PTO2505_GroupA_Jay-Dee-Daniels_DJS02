# PodcastPreview Web Component

## What This Is

The **PodcastPreview Web Component** is a small piece of a website that shows a preview of a podcast. It looks like a little card with the podcast’s picture, name, categories (genres), number of seasons, and when it was last updated. When someone clicks on it, it can open a bigger view or do something else you set up.

## Why It Exists

This project was made to make it easy for anyone building a website to show podcast previews in a neat and consistent way. Instead of creating the same layout over and over, you can just use this ready‑made piece.

## What It Uses

You don’t have to install anything complicated. It’s built with:

* HTML – the language of web pages.
* CSS – for how things look (colors, layout, fonts).
* JavaScript – to make it interactive when people click on it.

## What It Can Do

* Shows a podcast’s picture, title, categories, number of seasons, and last updated date.
* Looks good on phones and computers (it’s responsive).
* Works with keyboard as well as mouse clicks for better accessibility.
* Sends out a signal when someone clicks on it, so you can open a bigger view or take another action.

## How To Use It (Step by Step)

1. **Get the Files**
   Download the two files: one is the component, the other is a sample page showing it in action.

2. **Open the Demo Page**
   Double‑click on the demo page in your folder. It will open in your web browser and you’ll see example podcast cards.

3. **Use It On Your Own Page**
   If you have a web page, include the component and add the podcast card where you want it on your page. This will show a card with your own podcast info.

4. **Making It Do Something When Clicked**
   You can set it up so that when people click on the podcast card, a bigger view or another action happens.

That’s it! You now have a simple way to display podcast previews on your site without needing to build them from scratch.
